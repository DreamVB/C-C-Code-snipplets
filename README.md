# C/C++ Code Snippets Viewer
A collection of C/C++ code snippets

This is a collection of Source codes I was making when learning C++ but the collection of code grew so I decided to create a program to view them all and to share with other people. I am going to keep building this collection as far as I can. And with time add other programming languages to build the biggest Open Source collection of tips & trick to help people out.

If you like to help out you can do by submitting code snippets or help with the program you can contact me direct at dreamvb@outlook.com
